## Patch notes for update 1.1
This is what's come to DimpleOS and what's gone from DimpleOS.

## 1.Driver glitch
There was a glitch in the boot menu where the Z drive appeared to be a D drive (which was the first drive when DimpleOS released). That has been fixed.

## 2.New apps
There are 2 new apps in the DimpleOS system. The first app is the DimpleDefender, which you can run by using the run feature and entering the name of the app. The DimpleDefender can scan your system for dangerous viruses that you could have installed via installer. The next app is the DimplePrompt, which is a shell in the OS. There is for now only 2 commands. One of them is b, which takes you back. The other one is a secret and you guys have to find out what it is ;)

## 3.Auto recovery tool
There is a new auto recovery tool that you can download in this resp, and it works by downloading it and moving it over to a USB drive. From that, you can use it on the DimpleOS system. If you corrupt your system, just plug in the USB and wait 0–3 seconds, and it will load in and give you an option to use the auto recovery tool.

## 4.Running apps
You can now run system files that you can see in the files tab without admin permission and changing anything in the admin control panel. And if you run them, you will encounter another secret and you will get to try the new auto recovery system. In a late fix of v1.1, you will be able to switch out the system to bob's game 3, and you will be able to play bob's game 3 in DimpleOS.

## 5.Custom system
You will now be able to create your own custom Dimple system with the booter, and there are 4 built-in custom systems. If you download a custom system set and boot from it and see [unregistered system], don't be worried — it's normal because the system does not have that kind of files to register as a system, so it will remain unregistered unless you create your own custom system in another update when that feature gets updated. As I said, there are 4 custom systems you can download in the booter, and what happens when you boot into a custom system remains a secret :)
