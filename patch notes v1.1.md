# patch notes for uppdate 1.1
this is whats come to DimpleOS and whats gone from DimpleOS.

## 1. driver glitch
there was a glitch in the boot menu where the Z drive apeared to be a D drive (witch was the first drive when DimpleOS released)
that has been fixed

## 2. new apps
there are 2 new apps in the DimpleOS system the first app is the DimpleDefender witch you can run by using the run feture and entering
the name of the app. The DimpleDefender can scan you system for dangerous viruses that you could have installed via installer. The next app
is the DimplePrompt witch is a shell in the OS, there is for now only 2 commands one of them is b witch takes you back the other one is a 
secret and you guys have to find out what it is ;)

## 3. auto recovery tool
there is a new auto recovery tool that you can download in this resp and it works by downloading it and moving it over to and USB drive
and from that you can use it on the DimpleOS system, if you corrupt your system just plug in the usb and wait 0 - 3 seconds
and it will load in and give you an option to use the auto recovery tool.

## 4. runing apps
you can now run system files that you can see in the files tab without admin premition and changing any thing in the
admin controll panel and if you run them you will encounter another secret
and you will get to try the new auto recovery system. in a late fix of v1.1 you will be able to 
switch out the system to bob's game 3 and you will be able to play bob's game 3 in DimpleOS.

## 5. custom system
you will now be able to create your own custom Dimple system with the booter and there are 4 built in custom system
and if you download a custom system set and boot from it and see [unregisterd system] dont be worried, its normal
because the system does not have that kind of files to register as a system so it will remain unregisterd uless 
you create your own custom system in another uppdate when that feture gets uppdated. As i said there is 4 custom
systems you can download in the booter and what happens when you boot in to a custom system remains a secret :)
