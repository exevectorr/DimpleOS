# DimpleOS v1.1
DimpleOS is a batch-based fake operating system that is fun to play and mess around with.
Just so you know, DimpleOS is still in early development and is not fully developed, so some things can make the file just exit.

## How to use
First, download the DimpleOS1.bat file and the DimpleOS-booter.bat, then open the DimpleOS-booter.bat because you need the system before booting the batch OS simulator. If it is your first time using it, you will need to download the system. When it is downloaded, it will boot up DimpleOS.

Always open the DimpleOS-booter.bat when you want to use the batch OS. If you accidentally delete some system file, just go in the booter and it will use the auto recovery tool to recover your corrupted or lost data.

# Update 1.1 finally out!!!
The update of v1.1 is finally out!! To update, re-download both the booter and the DimpleOS! If you want to see what's new and what's gone, check the patch-notes.md file.

## Auto recovery tool
Download the auto recovery tool on a USB drive to use it in the DimpleOS system. If your system gets corrupted, the auto recovery tool will recover the corrupted data for you and fix your system if you get a virus in this new update v1.1.

## Dead ends
As I said at the start, this batch script is not fully developed and has some dead ends that are still being developed
If you find one, just boot it up again and avoid doing what you did to not go down a dead end.

## Secret
Here is a little secret! If you boot up the OS and go into the Boot settings and choose the system-file executor.
When you have done that, enter dimpsys and see what happens next.

There are now many more secrets in the new update 1.1, and I am going to leak one — try typing destroy.OS in the new Dimple terminal.
Be ready with your auto recovery tool on your USB drive.

There are a lot more secrets in the boot settings coming soon. Keep an eye out in the boot settings after every update, and you might find a new secret. If you do find a new secret, feel free to leak it on whatever platform — Discord, Snapchat, or TikTok. You can leak secrets if you find them. Just remember to follow the license!
